# :open_umbrella: 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard :closed_umbrella:
  

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)


## Description 

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast

```

## Instructions

In localhost, right click on the `index.html` file and open in browser.   Once the Dasboard-Weather app is rendered in the browser, enter a city name in the search box.  The current temperature of the city is displayed in the upper container with `temperture`, `humidity`, `wind speed` and `UV IndexSteps`.  If the UVIndex is less than 3, then there is green button, next to the index reading.  If less than 7, then Yellow, which is a warning; if greater then Red, which is dangerous. In the bottom contain the forcast for the next 5 days will also be displayed. Open the `Inspect` and then go to `Application`, click on `local Storage`, then open the dropdown.  In the preview window you should be able to see the save entries you entered of each City.   To clear the Local Storage area, select the `clear all` icon which is a small circle with a line through it 

To view the [Deployed](https://whintzen.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/index.html) App, you can either clicked on `Deployed` which will open the App in Github.  Once the Dasboard-Weather app is rendered in the browser, enter a city name in the search box.  The current temperature of the city is displayed in the upper container with `temperture`, `humidity`, `wind speed` and `UV IndexSteps`.  If the UVIndex is less than 3, then there is green button, next to the index reading.  If less than 7, then Yellow, which is a warning; if greater then Red, which is dangerous.  In the bottom contain the forcast for the next 5 days will also be displayed.

Check out the [ScreenShot](https://github.com/whintzen/Weather-Dashboard/blob/master/assets/images/Screenshot.png) of what the App looks like.
